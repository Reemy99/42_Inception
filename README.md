# 42_Inception

This project consists in having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different
services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You
have to use docker compose


#### Image in docker?

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that contains everything needed to run an application, including the application code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Docker images are created using a Dockerfile, which is a script that specifies the steps to build the image.

### Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

Start, stop, and rebuild services
View the status of running services
Stream the log output of running services
Run a one-off command on a service


### Docker Commands:

-f :flag is used to remove the running Docker containers forcefully.

--rmi all -v: options also used with the docker-compose down
    
  1- --rmi all: option tells Docker to remove all images associated with the containers being stopped.
  
  2- -v :tells Docker to remove the volumes associated with the containers.

2>/dev/null: redirects standard error (file descriptor 2) to /dev/null, effectively suppressing any error messages or output that might be generated by the docker compose down command.

|| true: ensures that even if the preceding command (in this case, docker compose down) fails and returns a non-zero exit status, the entire command will still return a successful (zero) exit status. It effectively ignores errors, allowing the Makefile to continue executing subsequent commands even if this one fails.
